Wordle
Thanks for reading this! It's just a small wordle game I wrote. 
********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Rules of Wordle: 
You have 6 chances to guess a five-letter word. 
After each time you submit your word, you will be given a feedback based on the background color of each letter: 
    · Green means the letter is in the word and in the right position;
    · Yellow means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position;
    · Grey means the letter is not in the word at all. 
If all your chances are used up and you still didn't get the word, you lose.
